## InventoryCheck

## Synopsis
InventoryCheck's main purpose is to provide the user with an application that allows the user to "check" their entered and documented items from their iventory. This allows the user to monitor the amount of items in their inventory and keep track of exactly what the user has in their inventory,based on a program given number. 

## Code
 ArrayList<InventoryItem> inventory = new ArrayList();
    JButton button1 = new JButton("Add Directory ");
    JButton button2 = new JButton("Remove Directory ");
    JButton button3 = new JButton("Add Item");
    JButton button4 = new JButton("Remove Item");
    JButton button5 = new JButton("Order");
    JButton button6 = new JButton("Search");
A portion of our code that shows how the user can access certain features of their invetory.
